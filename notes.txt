Typescript
    adds extra functionality to javaScript

Js is a subset of Typescript

all js is ts but not all ts is javaScript

benefits:
- static typing
- code completion
-refactoring
-shorthand notations

statically typed (c++, c# Java):
    int number = 10  -- you mut declare variable and declae what is being stored
    number = "a" ** immediatly errors
dynamically typed (javascript, python, ruby):
    let number = 10
    number = "a"
    math.round(number)** would error after compiling

typscript automatically errors anything that would immediatly flag during compilation

you need to configue the ts file before using ts

you have to tell ts what kind of thig you are storing in the variable

typescript is like javascript with type casting aka oop principles + more

obp - object based programming
oop - object oriented programming

pros:
    insane scalability
    ability to use features js cant in ja applications
    allows for better maitinence/ changes for the lifetime of the applications
cons:
    always have to compile
    stricter coding style
    technically more typing

js - jenga
ts - legos

why you should use it:

-research shows that ts can spot 15% of common bug
-readabuility its easier to see what code should do and when working in a team allows easier understanding
-it popular you can apply to more jobs
-learning typescript will give you a better understanding and a new persepctive on js
-addresses the shortcomings of js

why you shouldnt use ts

typescript takes longer to write than javascript as you have to specify types, so for smaller solo projects its probab;ly not worth it
ts has to be compiled which can take time, especially larger projects

but the extra time you have to spend writing more presice code and compiling will be more than saved by how many fewer bugs youll hvae in oyur code
for many projects especially medium to large typescipt saves you time and headaches
and if you know j, ts is easy to learning



npm install typescript --save-dev

npx tsc -v

npm init -y


declare variable:
var age : number = 17 ;

after declaring a varibale you cannot reassign the value from number to string ect.

you can declare arrays with a value like number[]

how to compile:
    -for a specific file, tsc [name of file]
    -for all files in the terminal folder, npx tsc
    -if you want a soecific name, tsc index.ts -- oufile file-name.js
    -have the files watched like Sass, tsc index.ts -w
